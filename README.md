## Key Insights & Visualizations
### Optimal Pricing Point
- Identified the price that maximizes profit ($111 with $31,980 profit).
- Beyond this price, demand drops sharply, reducing overall profitability.

### Competitor Influence Analysis
#### Higher Pricing Leads to Maximum Profit 
- The highest profit of $31,980 occurs at a price of $111, which is categorized as Above Competitor pricing.
- Despite lower demand (780 units), the higher price offsets the volume drop, leading to maximum profitability.
#### Competitive Pricing Is Not Always Optimal 
- Pricing within the Competitor Range (90-100 USD) generates stable profits but does not yield the highest returns.
- Lower prices (Below Competitor) attract higher demand but cap profit potential at $22,320, showing diminishing returns.
#### Strategic Takeaway: Premium Pricing Viability 
- If the product offers differentiated value, maintaining a higher-than-competitor pricing strategy could be viable.

### Discount Strategy & Profit Impact
- A 10% discount increases market reach and maximizes profit ($37,840 in the new market).
- A 20% discount has diminishing returns, reducing profitability in the long run.

#### Price Elasticity & Demand Sensitivity
- Price sensitivity increases above $100, leading to a steep drop in demand.
- A strategic price adjustment is necessary to balance revenue and market share.
